<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 2</span> Using Psychological Science to Inform Your Worldview</h1>
<p>Psychology is a very broad scientific discipline that asks and answers all sorts of questions about human and non-human animals. Psychological science encompasses many levels of analysis spanning the building blocks of biological systems, such as genes and cells, neurochemistry, neurons, and networks of neurons; perceptual and cognitive abilities of individuals such as learning, memory, attention, decision-making, language, thought, intelligence, and consciousness, to complex aspects of individuals such as development, personality, social behavior, and many others. A typical introductory psychology has the difficult job of presenting a bird’s eye view of all of these major psychological domains of inquiry. Although psychologists ask many different kinds of questions, they all employ the scientific method as a tool to answer questions. So, this course is an introduction to the scientific research methods that are used in all areas of Psychology.</p>
<p>The primary focus of the course will be on experiments, which is the most powerful empirical tool researchers have to determine the underlying causes of the psychological phenomena that they measure. Psychological research methods are not limited to experiments, and non-experimental, or quasi-experimental approaches are often used with great success to ask and answer questions. Some of these research methods will be highlighted throughout the course.</p>
<div id="why-should-i-care-about-how-psychology-experiments-work" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Why Should I Care About How Psychology Experiments work?</h2>
<p>Imagine for the moment a world without experiments that does not use the scientific method. This world would still have people claiming to have knowledge about how things work, and it would still have tools and technologies that are claimed to solve particular problems. However, without experiments to test whether the claims are true, all we are left with is the untested claims that may be true or false. We would be left in the dark. Inevitably, and not too different from our world today, there would be large segments of the population who believe false claims about how things work, and large segments of the population using therapies, tools, or other technologies that simply do not work (even if they believe they do).</p>
<p>The world we live in today discovered the scientific method and uses experiments to test claims about how things work. Indeed, with the enormous number of ways that we receive information through the media today, it is difficult to avoid hearing about all sorts of new scientific claims as well as totally unfounded claims that may not be based in science. For example, we have probably all heard that eating too much of something is good or bad for you, and increases or decreases your risk for a health problem. These claims can even flip around so that last year eating too much of X was bad, but this year eating too little of X is bad. What’s more, many of these claims are supposedly scientific ones based on experiments. Should you believe these claims, and should you change your own behavior because of them?</p>
<p>When we receive claims through the media we are getting second-hand information, and based on this information alone it is difficult to evaluate the claim and the evidence for the claim. One option is to find expert reporters that you trust, and then believe everything they say. The second option is to find the primary source, and then evaluate the evidence yourself to determine whether you should believe the claim. The ability to understand how experiments work gives you the tools you need to critically evaluate claims about how things work.</p>
</div>
<div id="evaluating-claims" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Evaluating Claims</h2>
<p>It is an understatement to say that people believe all sorts of crazy things. Note, this is a claim that I just made. Should you believe it? What do you need to know to determine whether or not you should believe this claim or any other claim? Scientific thinking requires that claims are supported by evidence. Other forms of belief and thinking may not require evidence to support claims.</p>
<p>For the moment I’ll put on my scientific thinking hat because there numerous ways that I can provide evidence for my claim the people believe all sorts of crazy things. I am a person, and I know that I have believed crazy things in the past. For example, when I was four I believed that all children grow to be taller than their parents because I visited a family who had many children of different ages, and the oldest ones were all taller than their parents. I believed this claim for many years until finding out at the age of 12 that all of the children in that family were adopted (nevertheless, I am taller than both my parents, but my brother is not, so much for my theory). The internet is full of people claiming to believe things that I think are completely crazy. For example, the flat earth society believes that the earth is flat and shaped like a frisbee. Believers in the great reptilian conspiracy maintain that many of our world leaders are lizard people. The abundance of conspiracy theories provides a deep well of evidence that people believe all sorts of crazy things. So, because I can back up my claim with evidence, I will continue believing that people believe all sorts of crazy things.</p>
<p>I could also take my science hat off, and then I can believe anything I want. Indeed, this remarkable imagination ability may be one reason why people believe so many crazy things without needing any evidence whatsoever to back up their beliefs. I can believe that I am a lizard monster who lives on a frisbee just because I want to. Indeed, the freedom to have your own opinion or belief about anything is a sacred cultural value in our western democracy. As citizens we respect each others right to their own opinions and beliefs. This is a way of respecting the right to have truthful and false and crazy beliefs, or respecting each others right to be completely wrong.</p>
</div>
<div id="testable-and-untestable-claims" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Testable and Untestable Claims</h2>
<p>The scientific method for determining whether claims are true or false, or somewhere in the middle, has limitations because it can only be used to evaluate testable claims. A testable claim is one that makes a clear implication about a state of the world. For example, I claim that I have two hands. This is a testable claim because it clearly implies that if someone were to observe my arms, they would expect to find two hands at the end of them. If they did not find two hands, then they could dispatch with my claim because the evidence showed I had no hands, which would be in direct contradiction with the claim. An untestable claim is nonsensical, or does not make a clear implication about a state of the world. For example, consider the claim “aldfoha ofghnfsklhjas asdfilubhs”. This is just nonsense, and no one knows what it means, it does not make clear implications about a state of the world, so we will never know if it is true or false. Consider the claim “the members of the Zarkovian alien race from planet Zarko in a parallel universe all look like perfect glass spheres”. This claim is possibly sensical, because it could be tested if we could travel to that planet and find members of the Zarkovian race, but it is not practically testable because the needed evidence can not be gathered; so, we will never know if this made up claim is true or false, or almost true (perhaps they are cubes or ellipsoids).</p>
<p>Claims and evidence are two central parts of the scientific method. And, in psychological science neither of these parts come for free. Researchers construct both of them. One job is to create claims that can be tested. The other job is to make the evidence by creating situations necessary to conduct the tests. Joining the creation of claims with the creation of testable situations produces evidence that bears directly on the claim. The evidence can be consistent or inconsistent with the claim, allowing the claim to continue to be accepted or rejected.</p>
<p>Here is another claim: People don’t always like to be wrong. I don’t always like to be wrong, so at least there is one example. People have beliefs that are near and dear to their heart, so close perhaps, that a person might be completely devastasted if they found out one of their precious ideas was wrong. For this reason, the evidence provided by scientific research may be viewed as a threat to a persons system of beliefs about the world. After all, when those beliefs involve testable claims, research can sometimes show those claims to be competely false. In which case, a rational person might be forced to delete parts of their beliefs that they would have preferred to hold on to. However, people aren’t always rational and discovering evidence does not force anyone to do anything. For example, lots of research shows that people can persevere in maintaining false beliefs, even after they are told about the evidence showing their beliefs are false. So, people really do believe crazy things.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-how-not-to-be-crazy" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Learning How Not To Be Crazy</h2>
<p>Learning about how experiments work is an opportunity to learn how not be crazy. Remember, experiments can only tell us about claims that can be tested, so we can not use this method to know whether our untestable beliefs are crazy. Fortunately, there are an endless number of testable claims that we can investigate that can add to the evergrowing library of human knowledge that science has produced so far, and be translated to applications that benefit ourselves, society, and the world around us.</p>
